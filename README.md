## Overview
The Sorting Visualizer allows users to select a sorting algorithm and observe how the elements in an array are sorted step-by-step. It visually demonstrates popular sorting algorithms and enhances learning through an interactive interface.

## Features
- Visualize popular sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- Customizable array size and speed of visualization.
- Shuffle or reset the array to try again.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Logic and animation for sorting algorithms.

## How to Use
1. Open the live link in your browser.
2. Select a sorting algorithm from the options.
3. Adjust the array size or visualization speed (optional).
4. Click on **Start** to begin the sorting visualization.
5. Use **Shuffle** to randomize the array again.

## Future Improvements
- Add more sorting algorithms like Heap Sort, Radix Sort, etc.
- Include a comparison feature to analyze sorting time complexity.
- Improve UI/UX with better visuals and animations.
- Support for custom input arrays.
